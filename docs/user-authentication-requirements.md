# User Authentication System Requirements

## Overview
Implementation of a role-based authentication system for the MealNetworks food donation platform with three distinct user types and an approval workflow.

## User Roles

### 1. SUPERADMIN
- **Quantity**: Single admin account for the entire application
- **Creation**: Created at developer end (not through UI)
- **Permissions**: 
  - View and manage all users
  - Approve/reject DONOR and RECEIVER registrations
  - Block/enable existing DONOR and RECEIVER accounts
  - Handle password reset requests from users
  - Approve phone number change requests
  - Full system access and control

### 2. DONOR
- **Registration**: Self-registration available to public
- **Purpose**: Users who want to donate food
- **Status Flow**: Registration → Pending → Admin Approval → Active

### 3. RECEIVER
- **Registration**: Self-registration available to public  
- **Purpose**: Users who need food (NGOs/organizations from existing registration system)
- **Status Flow**: Registration → Pending → Admin Approval → Active
- **Integration**: Same as existing NGO registration system

## Application Access & UI/UX Flow

### Public Access
- **Anyone can access the application** without authentication
- **Current frontend state** remains visible to all visitors
- **Anonymous browsing** of all existing pages (About, Contact, Reviews, etc.)

### Authentication UI Elements
- **Profile Icon**: Located beside 'Contact Us' on the right side of navigation
- **Login Modal**: Profile icon opens a modal with login functionality
  - **Login Fields**: Email ID and Password
  - **Registration Link**: Option to switch from login to registration modal
- **Unified Login**: Single login form for all user types (SUPERADMIN, DONOR, RECEIVER)
  - Backend determines user role after successful authentication
  - No role selection during login process
- **Pending Approval State**: Users with pending registration see "Pending Approval" message upon login attempt
- **Role-Based Navigation**: Navigation menu changes based on authenticated user role
  - **SUPERADMIN**: Dashboard, Donors, Receivers, Donation Sessions
  - **DONOR**: Dashboard, Make Donation, My Donations
  - **RECEIVER**: Dashboard, Food Requests, Received Donations
  - **Public (Unauthenticated)**: Home, About, Donation, Register Your NGO, What People Say, Initiative, Contact Us
- **Logo Click Behavior**: Logo redirects to appropriate dashboard when logged in, otherwise to home page

### Registration Entry Points
- **Donation Page**: Contains "Apply for Donor" button for anonymous users
- **Profile Icon Modal**: Login modal includes registration link for DONOR registration
- **Both Entry Points**: Lead to the same DONOR registration modal/page
- **RECEIVER Registration**: Integrated with existing NGO registration system

## User Management & Profile System

### Account Status Management
- **SUPERADMIN Control**: Can block/enable existing DONOR and RECEIVER accounts
- **Status Types**: Active, Blocked, Pending, Rejected
- **Account Actions**: Block prevents login, Enable restores access

### Profile Management Rules
- **Editable Fields**: Most profile information can be updated after approval
- **Restricted Fields**: 
  - Aadhaar card information (cannot be changed)
  - Email ID (cannot be changed)
- **Phone Number**: Can be changed but requires SUPERADMIN approval (no documentation needed)
- **Dedicated Profile Tabs**: Separate sections for DONOR and RECEIVER users
- **Password Management**: Users can change passwords in their profile section
- **Session Management**: Users remain logged in until manual logout (no automatic timeout)

### Password Reset Workflow
- **Forgot Password**: Available from login page
- **Process**: Sends request to SUPERADMIN (not automated)
- **SUPERADMIN Action**: Manually handles password reset requests
- **Use Case**: When users forget passwords and cannot access accounts

## Notification System

### Email Notifications
- **Email Service**: Nodemailer + Gmail SMTP (free tier - 500 emails/day)
- **Implementation**: To be developed later in the project

#### Email Scenarios
1. **Account Creation Emails**:
   - **Trigger**: After SUPERADMIN approves user registration
   - **Recipients**: DONOR/RECEIVER email addresses
   - **Content**: Welcome message, account activation confirmation, user role, next steps

2. **Donation Session Progress Emails**:
   - **Trigger**: When donation session status changes to "ACTIVE"
   - **Recipients**: Both DONOR and RECEIVER involved in the session
   - **Content**: Session details, unique donation session ID, contact information
   - **Templates**: Different perspectives for DONOR vs RECEIVER

3. **Account Status Change Emails**:
   - **Trigger**: When SUPERADMIN blocks/enables user accounts
   - **Recipients**: Affected user's email address
   - **Content**: Account status notification, reason (optional), contact information

#### Email Templates Required
- **Welcome Email** (Account approved)
- **Session Started Email** (For DONOR)
- **Session Started Email** (For RECEIVER)
- **Account Blocked Email**
- **Account Enabled Email**

#### SMTP Configuration
- **SMTP Host**: smtp.gmail.com
- **SMTP Port**: 587
- **Authentication**: Gmail App Password (requires 2FA)
- **Security**: Environment variables for credentials storage
- **Rate Limiting**: ~100 emails/hour recommended

## Donation Session System

### Map Integration & Location-Based Matching
- **Map Service**: Google Maps API (free tier for low traffic)
- **Distance Display**: Kilometers for distances ≥1km, meters for distances <1km
- **Distance-Based Matching**: RECEIVERs displayed to DONORs based on nearest distance
- **Location Services**: Both DONOR and RECEIVER profiles include location information

#### Location Data Collection
- **RECEIVER Location (Mandatory)**:
  - During RECEIVER (NGO) registration, Google Maps integration is **required**
  - User must select their organization's physical location on Google Maps
  - System captures and stores:
    - **Latitude** (decimal degrees)
    - **Longitude** (decimal degrees)
    - **Formatted Address** (from Google Maps geocoding)
  - Location data is stored in the User table (latitude, longitude fields)
  - This location becomes the pickup/delivery point for donations
  - Location accuracy is critical for distance-based matching with DONORs

- **DONOR Location (Optional)**:
  - DONORs may provide location during registration for convenience
  - Can be updated or provided later when creating donation sessions
  - Not mandatory at registration time

#### Google Maps Implementation Requirements
- **Map Selector Component**:
  - Interactive Google Maps embedded in RECEIVER registration form
  - Drag-and-drop marker to select exact location
  - Search functionality to find address
  - Auto-complete for address input
  - "Use Current Location" button (browser geolocation)
  - Visual confirmation of selected location before submission

- **Geocoding Integration**:
  - Convert address text to coordinates (forward geocoding)
  - Convert coordinates to formatted address (reverse geocoding)
  - Validate location is within serviceable area (if applicable)

- **Data Validation**:
  - Ensure latitude/longitude are valid coordinates
  - Check if coordinates fall within expected geographic boundaries
  - Prevent submission if location is not selected
  - Store original address text along with coordinates for reference

### Donation Session Concept
- **Definition**: A donation session is a singular entity representing one complete donation transaction
- **Participants**: Each session connects one DONOR with one RECEIVER
- **Unique Session ID**: System generates unique identifier for each donation session
- **Session Tracking**: Donation session ID enables tracking and reference of specific donations

### Historical Data & Analytics

#### DONOR Dashboard
- **Personal History**: View all donations made since account creation
- **Session Overview**: Access to all donation sessions initiated by the DONOR
- **Session Details**: Complete information about each donation transaction

#### RECEIVER Dashboard  
- **Received Donations**: View all donations received since account creation
- **Session History**: Access to all donation sessions received by the RECEIVER
- **Donation Analytics**: Historical data and trends of received donations

#### SUPERADMIN Dashboard
- **Navigation**: Dedicated pages for Dashboard, Donors, Receivers, and Donation Sessions
- **Dashboard Page** (`/admin`): 
  - Complete overview of all users (DONORs, RECEIVERs)
  - User approval/rejection functionality
  - Account control (block/enable users)
- **Donors Page** (`/admin/donors`):
  - List of all DONOR users with status
  - Filter and search functionality
  - Quick access to donor details
- **Receivers Page** (`/admin/receivers`):
  - List of all RECEIVER users with status
  - Filter and search functionality
  - Quick access to receiver details
- **Donation Sessions Page** (`/admin/donation-sessions`):
  - Complete list of all donation sessions
  - Session status tracking
  - DONOR-RECEIVER relationship view
  - Session search by unique ID
- **Data Retention**: Historical donation session data retained permanently

### Donation Session Data Structure
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **DONOR Information**: Complete donor details and profile
- **RECEIVER Information**: Complete receiver details and profile  
- **Transaction Details**: Donation specifics, timing, status
- **Location Data**: Geographic information for both parties
- **Session Status**: Current state of the donation process
  - **PENDING**: Session created, awaiting confirmation
  - **ACTIVE**: Session confirmed and in progress
  - **COMPLETED**: Donation successfully completed
  - **CANCELLED**: Session terminated before completion

## Authentication Method

### Simple Authentication
- **Method**: Email ID and Password
- **No OAuth**: Simple email/password authentication only
- **Security**: Standard password hashing and session management

## Registration & Approval Workflow

### DONOR Registration Process (Multiple Entry Points)
1. **Via Donation Page**:
   - Anonymous user visits Donation page
   - User clicks "Apply for Donor" button
   - User redirected to DONOR registration page
2. **Via Profile Icon**:
   - User clicks profile icon → login modal opens
   - User clicks registration link in login modal
   - Same DONOR registration modal/page opens
3. **Registration Completion**:
   - User fills basic details form
   - Account created with role "DONOR" in "PENDING" status
   - User receives confirmation of registration submission

### RECEIVER Registration Process
1. **Integration with Existing NGO System**: Uses current NGO registration flow
2. **Registration Form**: NGO registration form with additional requirements:
   - **Basic Organization Information**: Name, registration number, type, contact details
   - **Contact Person Details**: Name, phone, email
   - **Address Information**: Complete address with city, state, pincode
   - **Google Maps Location (Required)**:
     - Interactive map selector to pinpoint exact organization location
     - System captures latitude and longitude coordinates
     - Validates location is selected before form submission
     - Location becomes the default pickup/delivery point for donations
   - **Service Details**: Service areas, capacity, preferred donation types
   - **Verification Documents**: Registration certificates, ID proof uploads
3. **Location Data Validation**:
   - System ensures latitude/longitude coordinates are captured
   - Validates coordinates are within valid geographic range
   - Prevents registration completion without location data
4. **Account Creation**: Creates user account with role "RECEIVER" in "PENDING" status
   - Location data (latitude, longitude) stored in User table
5. **Approval Process**: Same workflow as DONOR approval
   - SUPERADMIN can view organization location on map during approval

### General Registration Process
1. User accesses registration page (DONOR or RECEIVER)
2. User fills registration form with basic details
3. Account created in "PENDING" status with selected role
4. User receives confirmation of registration submission

### Admin Approval Process
1. SUPERADMIN views pending registrations in admin dashboard
2. SUPERADMIN reviews user details and application
3. SUPERADMIN approves or rejects registration
4. User status updated to "APPROVED" or "REJECTED"
5. User receives notification of decision

## Open Questions

1. **Distance Radius**: What maximum distance should be considered for showing nearby RECEIVERs? 
   - *Example: Should DONORs see RECEIVERs within 5km, 10km, 25km radius? Should this be user-configurable?*
   - *Example: If a DONOR is in downtown area, should they see RECEIVERs in suburbs 20km away, or only nearby ones within 2-3km?*
2. **Profile Field Validation**: What validation rules should apply to profile updates? *(To be discussed later)*
3. **Additional Admin Tools**: Should we add any other monitoring capabilities beyond user management and session tracking as requirements arise?
4. **Gmail Account Setup**: Should we create a dedicated Gmail account for the application or use an existing one?
5. **Email Template Design**: What should be the visual design and branding for email templates?
6. **Email Delivery Monitoring**: Should we implement email delivery tracking and failure handling?
7. **Google Maps API Configuration**:
   - Do we have a Google Cloud account with Maps API enabled?
   - Should we restrict the API key to specific domains/IP addresses?
   - What API usage limits should be set to stay within free tier?
   - Should we implement API call caching to reduce costs?
8. **Location Data Privacy**:
   - Should RECEIVER exact locations be visible to all DONORs or only during active sessions?
   - Should we implement location obfuscation (show approximate area instead of exact coordinates)?
   - How precise should the location marker be (building-level vs. area-level accuracy)?
9. **Geographic Boundaries**:
   - Should we restrict RECEIVER registration to specific regions/countries?
   - What should happen if location coordinates fall outside expected boundaries?
   - Should we support international locations or limit to specific geographic area?
